# Nudommy
A mostly-back node academic project

# Usage
If you are making changes use
```sh
npm run dev
```
This uses nodemon and will restart the server whenever a file changes.

If you want a better production-ready server run
```sh
npm run build
npm run start-prod
```
Note that `build` will only work if the dev dependencies are installed.
